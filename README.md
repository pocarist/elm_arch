# elm_arch
This program is a simple implementation of Elm architechture by OCaml.

Original: [elm-architecture-tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial)

I noticed [ocaml-vdom](https://github.com/LexiFi/ocaml-vdom) later. This is what I wanted to realize.
ocaml-vdom is much better.
